CUSTOM,BETWEEN_BOUNDS,"**Scenario overview:** This is a custom structure, so the key takeaway is how P&L changes as price moves."
CUSTOM,UNLIMITED_RISK,**High‑risk zone:** This structure can keep losing money if the stock keeps moving further against you.
STOCK_LONG,BELOW_LOWER_BOUND,**Down move:** Your shares lose value as the stock falls.
STOCK_LONG,BETWEEN_BOUNDS,**Near current level:** Your result is driven mainly by normal day‑to‑day stock movement.
STOCK_LONG,ABOVE_UPPER_BOUND,**Up move:** Your shares gain value as the stock rises.
STOCK_SHORT,BELOW_LOWER_BOUND,**Down move:** A stock decline benefits a short‑stock position (profits grow as price falls).
STOCK_SHORT,BETWEEN_BOUNDS,**Near current level:** Your result is driven mainly by normal day‑to‑day stock movement (in the opposite direction).
STOCK_SHORT,ABOVE_UPPER_BOUND,**Up move (risk):** A stock rally works against a short‑stock position and losses can grow as price rises.
LONG_CALL,BELOW_LOWER_BOUND,"**Premium‑at‑risk:** The stock is below your call strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), so the option’s value is limited unless the stock rebounds."
LONG_CALL,BETWEEN_BOUNDS,"**Decision zone:** Near your call strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), small moves can change the option’s value quickly."
LONG_CALL,ABOVE_UPPER_BOUND,"**Participation zone:** Above your call strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), gains tend to increase as the stock rises."
SHORT_CALL,BELOW_LOWER_BOUND,"**Income zone:** Below your call strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), the call is more likely to expire with limited value."
SHORT_CALL,BETWEEN_BOUNDS,"**Watch zone:** Near/above your call strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), upside gains can be partially offset and risk increases."
SHORT_CALL,UNLIMITED_RISK,"**High‑risk zone:** Above the call strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), losses can continue to grow if the stock keeps rising."
LONG_PUT,ABOVE_UPPER_BOUND,"**Premium‑at‑risk:** The stock is above your put strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), so the option’s value is limited unless the stock falls."

COVERED_CALL,ABOVE_UPPER_BOUND,"**Upside limited:** Above your call strike ({CapStrikeFmt}), further upside is typically capped because shares may be called away."
COVERED_PUT,BELOW_LOWER_BOUND,"**Down move (favorable):** A decline can help this structure, but outcomes depend on where the stock settles versus the put strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt})."

COVERED_PUT,ABOVE_UPPER_BOUND,"**Up move (risk):** If the stock rises above the put strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), the stock leg can drive losses; premium may only partially offset it."
PROTECTIVE_CALL,BELOW_LOWER_BOUND,**Down move (favorable):** A decline benefits the short‑stock leg; the call hedge may not be needed in this zone.
PROTECTIVE_CALL,BETWEEN_BOUNDS,"**Hedge carrying:** Near the call strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), the hedge can reduce upside risk, but it also has a carrying cost."
PROTECTIVE_CALL,ABOVE_UPPER_BOUND,"**Protection working:** Above the call strike ({PrimaryStrikeFmt}), the long call is designed to limit further losses from a rising stock."

PROTECTIVE_PUT,BELOW_LOWER_BOUND,"**Protection working:** Below the put strike ({FloorStrikeFmt}), the hedge is designed to limit further downside on the combined position."
COLLAR,ABOVE_UPPER_BOUND,"**Upside limited:** Above your call strike ({CapStrikeFmt}), further upside is typically capped because shares may be called away."
